See it live here: [Durand Dashboard](http://durand.nodejitsu.com/app/index.html#/)  

Durand Dashboard is a prototype application which provides a high-level sales overview for managers to set promotion goals and measure their effectiveness.

The dashboard enables managers to explore multiple sales and promotion metrics across various 
categories and brands at a glance.  Managers can also drill down into categories to see the performace of 
brands in the aggregate or over time and utalize an action menu for relevant information for upcoming promotion 
planning. 

## Technologies
#### [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/)  
The Angular Framework enabled us to build a single page application with dynamically updated data. 

#### [HighchartsJS](http://www.highcharts.com/)  
After working with D3 and Chart.js, we chose to build all of our charts with Highcharts.js because of it's extensive documentation and convience in creating the types of charts in our application.

#### [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)  
Twitter Bootstrap provided us with convienent JS functions and consistent column/row based layouts.  

#### [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/)  
NodeJS is badass... that is all.


## Challenges

Each technology we used came with it's own challenges, but AngularJS.

Doing it the right way and the challenges we ran into... why what we did is better vs. the alternatives.
